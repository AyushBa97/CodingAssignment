1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Solution:
There are two values of a Boolean Data Type:
True –-> 1
False --> 0

We can write them as following:
True, 1
False, 0

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Solution:
AND , OR , NOT

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Solution:
AND
A B   A*B
0 0    0
1 0    0
0 1    0
1 1    1

OR
A B   A+B
0 0    0
1 0    1
0 1    1
1 1    1

NOT
A    NOT A
0     1
1     0


4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) 
not (5 > 4) 
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) -
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) 
(True and True) and (True == False) 
(not False) or (not True) 


Solution:
EXPRESSION                             OUTPUT
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                   False
not (5 > 4)                            False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                    True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))              False
(True and True) and (True == False)    False
(not False) or (not True)              True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
Solution:
== , != , < , > , >=, <= 

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
Solution:
Assignment operator is used to assign values (on RHS of =) to variable/operand (LHS of =). An address in memory is allocated for storing data for a variable. 
Eg: a = 16

Equality operator is used for comparison between two objects. Object can be an integer or string or a user defines class. 
Eg: a == 1

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

Solution:
else:
  print('ham')
  print('spam')
  print('spam')

Output:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Solution:
spam = 1

def func(spam):

  if spam == 1:
    print("Hello")
  elif spam == 2:
    print("Howdy")
  else:
    print("Greetings!")
    
func(1)
func(2)
func(3)

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
Solution:
Ctrl + C

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Solution:
Break statement breaks out of the loop 
Continue statement continues to the next iteration in the loop .

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Solution:
range(10) , range(0, 10) and range(0, 10, 1) all work the same way and provide the same output.

Explanation:
In first range function we have defined the index we want the function to end i.e. 9 [(n-1)].
In the second range function we have defined the starting point i.e.  0 and end point i.e. 9.
In the third range function we have defined the starting point i.e. 0, end point i.e. 9 and the number of steps/interval for next step i.e. 1 [ 1, 1+1=2, 2+1=3 here +1 is used to shown the increment in steps].

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Solution:
# Using For loop
for i in range(11):
  print(i)
  
# Using While Loop
i=0
while i<=10:
  print(i)
  i += 1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
Solution:
From spam import bacon
	OR
Import spam.bacon
